## 优化案例

### 1.limit 大数

1. 原因

   - limit 100000, 20 的意思扫描满足条件的 100020 行(回表的){**可以查看 sql 的读取数据页的数量**}, 扔掉前面的 100000 行, 返回最后的 20 行
   - 大量的时间都花费在随机 IO[回表]上: 尤其查询偏移大于**10 万**以后查询时间急剧增加

   ```sql
   -- limit 大数: 慢 & 污染buffer pool
   select index_name,count(*)
   from information_schema.INNODB_BUFFER_PAGE
   where INDEX_NAME in('val','primary') and TABLE_NAME like '%test%'
   group by index_name;
   ```

2. 解决方案: `覆盖索引-数据ID`

   - limit 默认会加载所有数据并过滤掉前面的 10w 行, 只取 20 行: 不是很好
   - solution01: 使用条件过滤{将 limit 转换为过滤条件}
   - solution02: **利用覆盖索引, 省去回表的耗时: 写子查询去确定边界**
   - 也可以在业务允许的情况下, 限制页数

3. sample

   ```sql
   -- 慢 & 加载了很多热点不是很高的数据页到buffer pool, 会造成buffer pool的污染, 占用buffer pool的空间
   SELECT id, title, ico, create_time, create_user
   FROM article_copy1
   where `status` = '1'
   ORDER BY id DES LIMIT 100000, 10

   -- solution01: 将上一次的最大的id传递给前端
   SELECT id, title, ico, create_time, create_user
   FROM article_copy1
   WHERE `status` = '1' and id < 2155652
   ORDER BY id DESC
   LIMIT 10;

   SELECT id, title, ico, create_time, create_user
   FROM article_copy1
   WHERE `status` = '1' and id >= (SELECT id FROM article_copy1  WHERE `status` = '1' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 100000, 1)
   ORDER BY id DESC
   LIMIT 10
   ```

---

### 2. order by 无索引且有重复列, 使用 limit 会和预期不一样

1. pre env

   ```sql
   create table `ratings` (
      `id` int(11) not null auto_increment,
      `category` int(11) default null,
      primary key (`id`)
   ) engine=innodb auto_increment=11 default charset=utf8mb4 collate=utf8mb4_general_ci;

   insert into ratings (id, category) values (1, 1);
   insert into ratings (id, category) values (5, 1);
   insert into ratings (id, category) values (10, 1);
   insert into ratings (id, category) values (3, 2);
   insert into ratings (id, category) values (4, 2);
   insert into ratings (id, category) values (6, 2);
   insert into ratings (id, category) values (9, 2);
   insert into ratings (id, category) values (2, 3);
   insert into ratings (id, category) values (7, 3);
   insert into ratings (id, category) values (8, 3);
   ```

2. 执行的 SQL

   ```sql
   -- 实际: 1, 10, 5, 3, 4
   -- 预期: 1 5 10 3 4
   select * from ratings order by category limit 5;
   ```

3. 原因: 5.6 之后, 针对 order by limit 做了个小优化:

   - **排序字段无索引且列值不唯一时**: 优化器在遇到 order by limit 语句的时候使用了 priority queue
   - sort_buffer_size 小于 limit 数量的需要的西段(sort_key+rowid/`select 的字段`): 否则还是会使用 归并排序
   - 验证是否使用优先队列: `"filesort_priority_queue_optimization": {}`

4. 解决

   - 最优解: order by category,id

   ```sql
    -- 实际: 1, 10, 5, 3, 4
    -- 预期: 1 5 10 3 4
    select * from ratings order by category,id limit 5;
   ```

   - category 加索引: category 区分度不好

## sample

1. create table

```sql
create table db_test03(
  a int primary key not null auto_increment,
  c1 char(10),
  c2 char(10),
  c3 char(10),
  c4 char(10),
  c5 char(10)
);

insert into db_test03(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) values('a1','a2', 'a3', 'a4','a5');
insert into db_test03(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) values('b1','b2', 'b3', 'b4','b5');
insert into db_test03(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) values('c1','c2', 'c3', 'c4','c5');
insert into db_test03(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) values('d1','d2', 'd3', 'd4','d5');
insert into db_test03(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) values('e1','e2', 'e3', 'e4','e5');
```

2. create index

```sql
select * from test03;
create index idx_c1_c2_c3_c4 on test03(c1, c2, c3, c4) ;
```

3. `=`

```sql
-- show index from db_test03;

-- type: ref ref: const,const,const,const extra: null
explain select c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 from db_test03 where c1 = 'a1' and c3 = 'a3' and c2 = 'a2' and c4 = 'a4' ;
-- type: ref ref: const,const,const,const extra: using index
explain select c1, c2, c3, c4 from db_test03 where c1 = 'a1' and c3 = 'a3' and c2 = 'a2' and c4 = 'a4' ;

-- type: ref ref: const,const extra: using index
explain select c1, c2, c3, c4 from db_test03 where c1 = 'a1' and c2 = 'a2' ;

-- type:  all ref: null extra: using where
explain select c1, c2, c5 from db_test03 where c2 = 'a3' and c4 = 'a4'
-- type: index ref: null extra: using where; using index
explain select c1, c2 from db_test03 where c2 = 'a3' and c4 = 'a4'
```

4. `> <`

```sql
-- type: range ref: null extra: using index condition: 索引使用了 c1, c2, c3
