## sample

1. create table

```sql
create table db_test03(
  a int primary key not null auto_increment,
  c1 char(10),
  c2 char(10),
  c3 char(10),
  c4 char(10),
  c5 char(10)
);

insert into db_test03(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) values('a1','a2', 'a3', 'a4','a5');
insert into db_test03(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) values('b1','b2', 'b3', 'b4','b5');
insert into db_test03(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) values('c1','c2', 'c3', 'c4','c5');
insert into db_test03(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) values('d1','d2', 'd3', 'd4','d5');
insert into db_test03(c1,c2,c3,c4,c5) values('e1','e2', 'e3', 'e4','e5');
```

2. create index

```sql
select * from test03;
create index idx_c1_c2_c3_c4 on test03(c1, c2, c3, c4) ;
```

3. `=`

```sql
-- show index from db_test03;
